Here's a great README for your GitHub repository for your "Smart Waste Sorter" project. This is designed to be clear, professional, and easy for others to understand.

# Smart Waste Sorter

## Project Overview

The Smart Waste Sorter is an innovative and automated system designed to streamline waste management and promote recycling efficiency. Using a combination of a robotic arm, a camera with computer vision capabilities, and a micro-controller, this project automatically identifies and sorts different types of waste—such as plastic, paper, and metal—into their respective bins.

This project was developed with the goal of creating a practical solution to reduce contamination in recycling streams and encourage more effective waste disposal habits.

## Key Features

  * **Automated Sorting:** The system automatically sorts waste items based on material type.
  * **Computer Vision:** Utilizes a camera and machine learning models to accurately identify waste materials.
  * **Robotic Arm:** A precise robotic arm handles and places waste items into the correct bins.
  * **User Interface (Optional):** Can include a simple interface to display real-time sorting information or provide manual controls.
  * **Modular Design:** The system is built with modular components, making it easy to adapt or upgrade.
